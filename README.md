# Password-generator
This is a simple password generator that lets you create random passwords in a specified length.

## How it works
This generator asks you the number of passwords you want to generate at once, and then it asks you how many characters long the passwords should be. Then the program generates the passwords and shows you all of them aswell as saving them in a file.
